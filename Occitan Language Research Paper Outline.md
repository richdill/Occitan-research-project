# **The Occitan Diasystem: A Diachronic, Sociolinguistic, and Structural Analysis of the *Langue d'Oc***

## **1\. Introduction: Defining the Occitano-Romance Space within *Romania***

The linguistic landscape of Southern Europe is historically anchored by the Romance continuum, a vast dialectal chain stretching from the Atlantic coast of Portugal to the Black Sea coast of Romania. Within this continuum, the Occitan language—historically designated as the *langue d'oc* and occasionally referred to by synecdoche as Provençal or Limousin—occupies a central and pivotal position. It serves as the typological bridge between the Gallic Romance of the north (the *langues d'oïl*, ancestors of modern French) and the Ibero-Romance varieties of the south and west (Catalan, Aragonese, Castilian). However, Occitan is not merely a transitional zone; it constitutes a distinct "diasystem"—a linguistic complex characterized by a shared structural core yet marked by significant internal variation and a polycentric literary history.1

This report provides an exhaustive diachronic examination of Occitan, tracing its genesis from the distinct regional Vulgar Latin of southern Gaul (Gallia Narbonensis and Aquitania) through its meteoric rise as the vehicle of high medieval courtly culture, to its systematic sociolinguistic dismantling under the centralization of the French state. The analysis integrates complexity theory to understand dialectal fragmentation, specifically examining the "Oc" diasystem's internal dynamics and its separation from the "Oïl" system.1 Furthermore, we will interrogate the linguistic structures that define Occitan—its conservative phonology, its medieval binary case system, and the unique syntactic innovations of the Gascon dialect—while contextualizing these features within the broader trajectory of Romance evolution.

### **1.1 The Concept of the Diasystem and *Lenga d'òc***

The terminology surrounding Occitan has historically been fraught with political and philological ambiguity. Dante Alighieri, in his seminal treatise *De vulgari eloquentia* (c. 1302–1305), provided the first comparative classification of the Romance vernaculars based on their affirmative particle: the *lingua d’oïl* (French, from Latin *hoc ille*), the *lingua del sì* (Italian, from Latin *sic*), and the *lingua d’oc* (Occitan, from Latin *hoc*).4 This distinction highlights a fundamental divergence in the evolution of Latin particles, but modern linguistics requires a more granular definition.

Current research in dialectometry and complexity theory conceptualizes Occitan not as a monolithic standard but as a diasystem. According to recent analyses using the THESOC (Thesaurus Occitan) database, the Occitan domain is characterized by "macrodialects" and "segmental nexi" rather than rigid borders. The analysis identifies a primary "Arverno-Mediterranean" axis and an "Aquitano-Pyrenean" axis, with the "Croissant" zone serving as a transitional buffer where Oïl and Oc features merge.1 This diasystemic approach allows for the inclusion of highly divergent varieties, such as Gascon, which some scholars have argued constitutes a separate language due to its unique Aquitanian substrate, while still recognizing the supradialectal unity that allowed for the medieval literary *koinè*.

### **1.2 The Historiographical Trajectory**

The history of Occitan is frequently periodized into three phases:

1. **Emergence and Standardization (c. 800–1200):** The crystallization of distinct Romance features and the development of a prestigious literary standard used by the troubadours.  
2. **Decline and Diglossia (c. 1300–1850):** The loss of political independence following the Albigensian Crusade, the imposition of French as the language of administration (Villers-Cotterêts), and the relegation of Occitan to a vernacular *patois*.  
3. **Renaissance and Resistance (1850–Present):** The literary revival led by the Félibrige movement, the 20th-century Occitanist standardization, and the current struggle against severe endangerment.6

**2\. Proto-History: Substrates and the Formation of Southern Gallo-Romance**

The distinct character of Occitan, as opposed to French or Spanish, is the result of the specific superimposition of Roman Latin upon the indigenous substrate languages of Southern Gaul. Unlike Northern Gaul, where the Germanic (Frankish) superstrate exerted a profound phonological influence—causing extreme vowel reduction and diphthongization—the South remained a bastion of *Romania continua*. The Romanization was deeper, earlier, and less disrupted by Germanic invasions, allowing Occitan to retain a vocalic system and syllabic structure much closer to Latin.2

### **2.1 The Aquitanian Substrate: The Gascon Singularity**

The most significant substrate anomaly within the Occitan domain is found in the southwest, in the region historically known as Novempopulania or Gascony. Here, the pre-Roman population spoke **Aquitanian**, a non-Indo-European language genetically related to Proto-Basque. The interaction between Aquitanian and Latin produced **Gascon**, a dialect so divergent that it is often treated as a separate system in Romance linguistics.10

The Aquitanian substrate is responsible for a series of phonological shifts that isolate Gascon from the rest of the Occitan diasystem (and indeed, from most of Romance):

* **Labial-Dental Shift (*f* \> *h*):** The most famous feature is the aspiration of Latin initial /f/ to /h/. This phenomenon is shared with Castilian Spanish (which also had a Basque substrate) but is absent in other Occitan dialects.  
  * Lat. *filius* (son) \> Gasc. *hilh* (vs. Languedocien *filh*).  
  * Lat. *farina* (flour) \> Gasc. *haria* (vs. Languedocien *farina*).  
  * Lat. *femina* (woman) \> Gasc. *hemna*.12  
* **Loss of Intervocalic *\-n-*:** Aquitanian phonotactics likely disfavored intervocalic nasal consonants, leading to their deletion in Gascon.  
  * Lat. *luna* (moon) \> Gasc. *lua* (vs. Languedocien *luna*).  
  * Lat. *farina* \> Gasc. *haria*.11  
* **Prothesis before *r-*:** Initial /r/ required a prothetic vowel, a trait identical to Basque (e.g., *Radio* \> *Irratia*).  
  * Lat. *rota* (wheel) \> Gasc. *arroda* (vs. Languedocien *ròda*).  
  * Lat. *ripa* (bank) \> Gasc. *arribèra*.  
* **Betacism:** The merger of /b/ and /v/ into a bilabial /b/ or /β/ is a strong areal feature of Gascon and Languedocien, linking them to the Ibero-Romance sphere, whereas Provençal and Northern Occitan maintain the labiodental /v/ distinct from /b/.12

These features suggest that Gascon is not merely a dialect of Occitan but a "Romance language on a Basque substrate," contrasting with the rest of Occitan which is "Romance on a weaker Celtic/Ligurian substrate."

### **2.2 The Ligurian and Celtic Layers**

East of the Rhône, particularly in Provence and the Alpine valleys, traces of a **Ligurian** substrate persist. While less distinct than Aquitanian, Ligurian influence is hypothesized in certain toponyms (suffixes in *\-ascu*, *\-oscu*) and lexical items related to Alpine terrain.

* **Toponymy:** Place names ending in *\-sque* (e.g., Manosque, Venasque) act as markers of the ancient Ligurian territory.10  
* **Lexical Survivals:** Words such as *balma* (cave/shelter under a rock) are attributed to a pre-Indo-European Alpine substrate, potentially Ligurian.14

The **Gaulish (Celtic)** substrate, while pervasive throughout France, influenced the South differently than the North.

* **The *u* \> *y* Shift:** The fronting of Latin /u/ (as in *moon*) to the high front rounded vowel /y/ (as in French *tu* or Occitan *tu*) is a pan-Gallo-Romance feature often attributed to the Celtic substrate. This isogloss sharply divides Occitan (and French) from Italian and Spanish, which retain the back vowel \[u\].  
* **Lexicon:** Celtic loanwords in Occitan are concentrated in agriculture, rural life, and terrain. Examples include *carr* (chariot/cart), *camba* (leg, from Gaulish *cambas*), and *breu* (thicket).2

### **2.3 Greek Influence in Provence**

The colonization of Massalia (Marseille) by Phocaean Greeks around 600 BC established a long-standing Hellenic presence in Provence. While Greek did not replace the indigenous languages deep inland, it contributed a specific layer of vocabulary to the Provençal dialect, particularly regarding maritime activities and viticulture. Words such as *broumet* (bait) and *empeltar* (to graft) are cited as Greek loanwords that entered the regional Latin.10

**3\. Linguistic Structure: Phonology, Morphology, and Syntax**

The linguistic structure of Occitan is often described as conservative relative to French, preserving features of Vulgar Latin that were eroded in the *Oïl* varieties. This conservatism allowed Occitan to serve as a bridge language, intelligible to speakers of Catalan and Italian during the Middle Ages.

### **3.1 Diachronic Phonology**

The phonological evolution of Occitan is characterized by the stability of the tonic vowel system and the preservation of unstressed final vowels, which prevented the radical syllabic collapse seen in French.

#### **3.1.1 The Vocalic System**

Occitan generally developed a seven-vowel system in stressed syllables, similar to Vulgar Latin: /i/, /e/, /ɛ/, /a/, /ɔ/, /o/, /u/. However, a key evolution occurred with the high back vowel.

* **Palatalization of *u*:** As noted, Latin *ū* shifted to /y/. To fill the gap left in the back vowel space, the Latin *ō* (and *ŭ*) shifted to /u/.  
  * Lat. *durum* \> Occ. *dur* \[dyr\] (hard).  
  * Lat. *florem* \> Occ. *flor* \[flur\] (flower).12  
* **Diphthongization:** Unlike French and Spanish, Occitan resists spontaneous diphthongization in open syllables.  
  * Lat. *mĕl* \> Occ. *mèl* (honey) vs. Fr. *miel*, Sp. *miel*.  
  * Lat. *pŏrta* \> Occ. *pòrta* (door) vs. Sp. *puerta*.  
  * However, conditioned diphthongization occurred in specific contexts (e.g., before palatals), leading to forms like *lieit* (bed) from *lectum*.12

#### **3.1.2 Consonantal Evolution and Palatalization**

A major isogloss dividing Northern Occitan (Limousin, Auvergnat) from Southern Occitan (Languedocien, Provençal) is the treatment of Latin /k/ and /g/ before 'a'.

* **North Occitan Palatalization:** Similar to French, the northern dialects palatalized *ca-* to *cha-* and *ga-* to *ja-*.  
  * Lat. *cantare* \> Limousin *chantar* (to sing).  
  * Lat. *gallus* \> Limousin *jal* (rooster).  
* **Southern Conservatism:** Languedocien and Provençal retained the velar stops.  
  * Lat. *cantare* \> Lgd. *cantar*.  
  * Lat. *gallus* \> Lgd. *gal*.12

This feature is critical for dialect classification and links North Occitan typologically closer to the *Oïl* zone, reflecting the permeability of the linguistic border.

### **3.2 Old Occitan Morphosyntax: The Two-Case System**

One of the most defining features of Old Occitan (shared with Old French) was the retention of a **binary case system** for nouns and adjectives. This system represents a transitional stage between the complex six-case system of Latin and the non-inflected system of modern Romance.

The system distinguished between the **Nominative** (Subject) and the **Oblique** (Object/Prepositional) case.

**Table 3: The Old Occitan Declension Paradigm (Masculine)**

| Declension Type | Number | Case | Form | Origin (Latin) | Example (Murs \- Wall) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Type I (Classic)** | Singular | **Nominative** | *\-s* | *\-us* | *li murs es auts* (the wall is high) |
|  |  | **Oblique** | *—* | *\-um* | *vei lo mur* (I see the wall) |
|  | Plural | **Nominative** | *—* | *\-i* | *li mur son aut* (the walls are high) |
|  |  | **Oblique** | *\-s* | *\-os* | *vei los murs* (I see the walls) |
| **Type II (Imparisyllabic)** | Singular | **Nominative** | *\-s* | *(variable)* | *homs* (man) |
|  |  | **Oblique** | *(stem)* | *\-em* | *home* |
|  | Plural | **Nominative** | *(stem)* | *\-es* | *home* |
|  |  | **Oblique** | *\-s* | *\-es* | *homes* |

This "sigmatic" nominative (marked by *\-s* in the singular) was a source of confusion for later philologists and early revivalists, as it functioned inversely to the plural marker in the nominative case. In the plural nominative, the *\-s* is absent (derived from Latin *\-i*), but in the plural oblique, it is present (derived from Latin *\-os*).

**The Collapse of the System:** By the 13th and 14th centuries, phonetic erosion (the weakening of final *\-s* in some dialects) and syntactic pressure led to the collapse of this system. The oblique form, which was used more frequently (as direct object, indirect object, and object of prepositions), generally ousted the nominative to become the single form in modern Occitan. For example, the modern word for "neighbor" is *vesin* (from oblique *vicinum*), not *vesies* (from nominative *vicinus*).16

### **3.3 Verbal Morphology and Syntax**

#### **3.3.1 The Future and Conditional**

Old Occitan provides clear evidence of the grammaticalization path of the Romance future tense. The future was formed by the infinitive \+ the present tense of *aver* (to have). Unlike modern French, where this is fused (e.g., *chanterai*), Old Occitan allowed **mesoclisis**—the insertion of a pronoun between the infinitive and the auxiliary.

* *Cantar l'ai* (I will sing it) — literally "To sing it I have." This feature links Old Occitan with Old Spanish and Old Catalan, where similar structures were permissible.18

The **Conditional** mood presented a dual system:

1. **Conditional I:** Infinitive \+ Imperfect of *aver* (e.g., *cantaria*).  
2. **Conditional II:** Derived directly from the Latin Pluperfect Indicative (*\-aram*). For example, *cantara* could mean "I would sing" or "I would have sung." This form is cognate with the Spanish *\-ara* form (now imperfect subjunctive).17

#### **3.3.2 Enunciative Particles in Gascon**

A unique syntactic feature of Gascon is the obligatory use of **enunciative particles** before finite verbs in main clauses. This system marks the illocutionary force or aspect of the sentence.

* **Que:** The general affirmative particle. *Que soi gascon* (I am Gascon). It serves as a syntactic pivot, allowing the verb to stand without a subject pronoun.  
* **E:** Used for questions or indefinite statements.  
* **Be:** Used for emphatic affirmation. *Be soi gascon\!* (Indeed, I am Gascon\!).11 This system is typologically rare in Western Europe and further underscores the deep divergence of Gascon.

#### **3.3.3 Negation and the Jespersen Cycle**

Old Occitan negation relied primarily on the preverbal particle *non* (or *no*). However, to add emphasis, speakers used "minimizers"—nouns indicating small quantities.

* *Pas* (step)  
* *Ges* (speck/bit)  
* *Miga* (crumb)  
* *Gota* (drop)

Over time, through **Jespersen's Cycle**, these emphatic markers became obligatory, eventually allowing the preverbal *non* to be dropped in some modern dialects.

* Stage 1: *No canti.* (Old Occitan)  
* Stage 2: *No canti pas.* (Classic/Modern)  
* Stage 3: *Canti pas.* (Modern Spoken) The particle *ges* was particularly common in troubadour poetry as a strong negative (*no... ges*), contrasting with the *pas* that became standard in French and Languedocien.20

**4\. The Golden Age: Troubadours and the Sociolinguistics of Prestige**

Between the late 11th and early 13th centuries, Occitan was the premier literary language of Europe. This prestige was not merely aesthetic but sociolinguistic: Occitan functioned as a supra-regional *koinè* that transcended the political fragmentation of the Midi.

### **4.1 The Troubadour Phenomenon**

The troubadours (from the verb *trobar*, "to find" or "to compose") revolutionized European literature by inventing **Fin'amor** (Courtly Love). This was a sophisticated sociological and literary game that transposed feudal vocabulary onto gender relations: the lady (*domna*) was the liege lord (*midons*, from *meus dominus*), and the poet was the vassal.

This literary production required a standardized language. The "Classic Occitan" of the troubadours was largely based on the Languedocien/Limousin dialects but stripped of highly local idiosyncrasies. This allowed a troubadour from Gascony (like Cercamon) to be understood in Italy or Catalonia.

* **Guilhem IX of Aquitaine (1071–1127):** The "first troubadour," whose works mix obscenity with refinement, demonstrating that the literary language was already fully formed by 1100\.  
* **Bernart de Ventadorn:** The master of the *trobar leu* (light/easy style), whose widely circulated songs cemented the standard vocabulary of love.  
* **Arnaut Daniel:** The practitioner of *trobar clus* (closed/hermetic style), admired by Dante for his technical mastery.23

### **4.2 The Chansonniers: Manuscripts as Cultural Artifacts**

The transmission of this poetry relied on **chansonniers**—anthologies compiled in the 13th and 14th centuries. Interestingly, many of the most significant chansonniers were produced in Italy (Veneto region), reflecting the diaspora of Occitan culture.

* **Manuscript A (Vatican Lat. 5232):** A masterpiece of organization, containing *vidas* (biographies) and *razos* (explanations) that provide the context (often fictionalized) for the poems.  
* **Manuscript R (BnF fr. 22543):** Crucial for musicology as it preserves the musical notation for many songs.  
* **Artistic Features:** These manuscripts are often **illuminated**. Miniatures depict the troubadours in stylized poses: the poet pointing to his heart, the lady accepting a manuscript, or the poet on horseback. These images served to mythologize the authors, creating a celebrity culture around figures like Jaufré Rudel and his "distant love".26

### **4.3 Influence on the Sicilian School and Minnesang**

The prestige of Occitan led to "glottophagy" (linguistic absorption) in neighboring regions.

* **Catalonia:** For centuries, Catalan poets wrote in Occitan, considering it the only appropriate language for lyric poetry.  
* **Italy:** The **Sicilian School** (c. 1230–1266) at the court of Frederick II adapted troubadour themes and forms (like the *canzone*) into the Sicilian vernacular. However, the influence was so strong that early Italian poets often used Occitanisms (*gallicisms*) and even wrote entirely in Occitan (e.g., Sordello da Goito).28  
* **Germany:** The **Minnesang** tradition was a direct adaptation of the troubadour lyric, importing the concept of *Hohe Minne* (High Love) and specific strophic forms.25

## ---

**5\. The Sociolinguistic Rupture: Crusade and Conquest**

The decline of Occitan was triggered by a violent external shock: the **Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229)**.

### **5.1 The Crusade as a Linguistic Turning Point**

Ostensibly a religious war against the Cathar heresy, the Crusade was effectively a war of conquest by the Northern French barons (led by Simon de Montfort) and the French Crown against the independent counts of Toulouse and their vassals.

* **The End of Patronage:** The destruction of the southern courts (Toulouse, Béziers, Carcassonne) decimated the economic base of the troubadours. The "Joy" and "Youth" (*Joven*) essential to the culture were replaced by the grim reality of occupation and the Inquisition.  
* **Shift in Genre:** Literary production shifted from the love song (*canso*) to the political satire (*sirventes*). The *Canso de la Crosada* documents this shift: the first part (by Guilhem de Tudela) is pro-Crusader and chronicles events; the second part (by an anonymous poet) is a passionate, anti-French nationalist epic that laments the destruction of *Paratge* (Southern honor/civilization).30

### **5.2 The *Leys d'Amors*: Codification of a Dying Tongue**

In the wake of the defeat, the **Consistori del Gay Saber** was founded in Toulouse (1323) to preserve the "correct" art of poetry. They commissioned the **Leys d'Amors** (Laws of Love), a massive grammatical treatise.

* **Grammar as Defense:** The *Leys* attempted to fix the language in a static, perfect form, protecting it from "barbarisms" (i.e., French influence). While it successfully documented the *koinè*, the very need for such a prescriptive text signalled that the organic vitality of the high literary language was fading. The *Leys* defined the "Lenga d'òc" explicitly against the "Lenga francesa," marking a defensive posture.32

## ---

**6\. The Long Decline: From Villers-Cotterêts to *La Vergonha***

The transition from a language of culture to a "patois" was a centuries-long process engineered by state policy.

### **6.1 The Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts (1539)**

King Francis I signed the **Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts**, which contained two articles (110 and 111\) that changed the linguistic fate of France.

* **The Decree:** It mandated that all administrative acts and court proceedings be delivered *"en langaige maternel francoys et non aultrement"* (in the French mother tongue and not otherwise).  
* **The Impact:** While ostensibly aimed at replacing Latin, the ordinance effectively banned Occitan from the legal and administrative sphere. Occitan, which had been the language of notaries and city councils (consuls) for centuries, lost its *instrumentality*. It remained the oral language of the people, but it was no longer the language of power.6

### **6.2 The French Revolution and the "Annihilation of Patois"**

The French Revolution accelerated centralization. In 1794, Abbé Grégoire submitted his *Rapport sur la nécessité et les moyens d'anéantir les patois* (Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois). The Jacobin ideology equated the French language with reason, unity, and the Republic; regional languages were viewed as remnants of feudalism, superstition, and counter-revolution. This established the ideological framework for the erasure of Occitan.8

### **6.3 *La Vergonha* (The Shame)**

The most effective tool of linguicide was the national education system established in the late 19th century by Jules Ferry.

* **The Mechanism:** The policy known as *La Vergonha* involved the systematic shaming of students who spoke Occitan. Teachers used a "symbol" (a clog, a tile, or a stick) given to a child caught speaking the "patois." The child could only get rid of the symbol by catching another student speaking Occitan. The student holding the symbol at the end of the day was punished.  
* **Psychological Effect:** This induced a self-policing mechanism and a deep sense of shame associated with the native language. Parents, convinced that Occitan was a hindrance to their children's social advancement, stopped transmitting the language in the mid-20th century. This intergenerational rupture is the primary cause of the current endangered status of the language.7

**7\. Revival and Modern Status**

### **7.1 The Félibrige**

In 1854, seven poets led by **Frédéric Mistral** founded the **Félibrige** to restore the glory of the Provençal language. Mistral's epic *Mirèio* (1859) brought international attention to the language, culminating in his Nobel Prize in 1904\. The Félibrige promoted a spelling system based on French orthography (the "Mistralian norm"), which was accessible to French speakers but obscured the etymological links with other Occitan dialects and Catalan.36

### **7.2 Occitanism and the Classical Norm**

In the 20th century, the **Institut d'Estudis Occitans (IEO)** promoted the **Classical Norm**, standardized by Louis Alibert in 1935\. This orthography is based on medieval conventions, highlighting the unity of the language and its closeness to Catalan. Today, this is the standard used in academic and most literary contexts, though the Mistralian norm persists in Provence.38

### **7.3 Contemporary Sociolinguistics**

Today, Occitan is severely endangered.

* **Speaker Count:** Estimates range from 200,000 to 600,000 fluent speakers, mostly elderly.  
* **Status:** It has no official status in France (where Article 2 of the Constitution declares French the only language). However, **Aranese** (Gascon) is an official language in the Val d'Aran (Catalonia, Spain), where it is protected and taught.  
* **Revitalization:** The *Calandreta* schools (bilingual immersion) are the main engine of revival, creating a new generation of "neo-speakers." However, the lack of state support and the dominance of French in media make the future precarious.6

## ---

**8\. Conclusion**

The trajectory of Occitan—from the "courtly voice" of Europe to a "forbidden patois"—is a profound case study in the relationship between language and power. The language did not decline due to inherent inferiority; it was dismantled through specific military (Crusade), legal (Villers-Cotterêts), and educational (*La Vergonha*) interventions. Yet, its structural resilience, preserved in the conservative phonology of Languedoc and the archaic singularity of Gascon, continues to offer vital insights into the history of the Romance family. The persistence of the language today, however fragile, serves as a testament to the endurance of the *Oc* identity against the forces of linguistic homogenization.
